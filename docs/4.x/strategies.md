## Introduction

Strategies are a way of defining how a route callable is dispatched. A strategy defines what to do if a route is matched, if no route is found and what to do in certain error conditions.

Route provides two strategies out of the box, one aimed at standard web apps and one aimed at JSON APIs.

- `League\Route\Strategy\ApplicationStrategy` (Default)
- `League\Route\Strategy\JsonStrategy` (Requires a HTTP Response Factory)

## Applying Strategies

Strategies can be applied in three ways, each takes precedence over the previous.

### Globally

Will apply to all routes defined by the router unless the route or its parent group has a different strategy applied.

~~~php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

use League\Route\Strategy\ApplicationStrategy;

$router = new League\Route\Router;
$router->setStrategy(new ApplicationStrategy);
~~~

### Per Group

Applying a strategy to a group will apply it to all routes defined within that group as well as any errors that occur when a request is within the group prefix. In these cases, any globally applied strategy will be ignored.

~~~php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

use League\Route\Strategy\ApplicationStrategy;

$router = new League\Route\Router;

$router
    ->group('/group', function ($router) {
        $router->map('GET', '/acme/route', 'Acme\Controller::action');
        $router->put('/acme/route', 'Acme\Controller::action');
    })
    ->setStrategy(new ApplicationStrategy)
;
~~~

### Per Route

A strategy can be applied to any specific route, at top level or within a group, this will take precedence over any strategy applied to its parent group or globally.

~~~php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

use Acme\CustomStrategy;
use League\Route\Strategy\ApplicationStrategy;

$router = new League\Route\Router;

$router->map('GET', '/acme/route', 'Acme\Controller::action')->setStrategy(new CustomStrategy);

$router
    ->group('/group', function ($router) {
        $router
            ->map('GET', '/acme/route', 'Acme\Controller::action')
            ->setStrategy(new CustomStrategy) // will ignore the strategy applied to the group
        ;
    })
    ->setStrategy(new ApplicationStrategy)
;
~~~

## Application Strategy

`League\Route\Strategy\ApplicationStrategy` is used by default, it provides the controller with a PSR-7 `Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface` implementation and any route arguments. It expects your controller to build and return an implementation of `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface`.

### Controller Signature

~~~php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Zend\Diactoros\Response;

function controller(ServerRequestInterface $request, array $args) : ResponseInterface {
    // ...
    $response = new Response;
    $response->getBody()->write(/* $content */);
    return $response->withStatus(200);
});
~~~

### Exception Decorators

The application strategy simply allows any exceptions to bubble out, you can catch them in your bootstrap process or you have the option to extend this strategy and overload the exception decorator methods. See [Custom Strategies](#custom-strategies).

## JSON Strategy

`League\Route\Strategy\JsonStrategy` aims to make building JSON APIs a little easier. It provides a PSR-7 `Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface` implementation and any route arguments to the controller as with the application strategy, the difference being that you can either build and return a response yourself or return an array or object, and a JSON response will be built for you.

To make use of the JSON strategy, you will need to provide it with a [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) response factory implementation. Some examples of HTTP Factory packages can be found [here](https://github.com/http-interop?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=http-factory&type=&language=). We will use the `zend-diactoros` factory as an example.

~~~php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

$responseFactory = new Http\Factory\Diactoros\ResponseFactory;
$strategy = new League\Route\Strategy\JsonStrategy($responseFactory);

$router = (new League\Route\Router)->setStrategy($strategy);
~~~

### Controller Signature

~~~php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Zend\Diactoros\Response;

function responseController(ServerRequestInterface $request, array $args) : ResponseInterface {
    // ...
    $response = new Response;
    $response->getBody()->write(json_encode(/* $content */));
    return $response->withAddedHeader('content-type', 'application/json')->withStatus(200);
});

function arrayController(ServerRequestInterface $request, array $args) : array {
    // ...
    return [
        // ...
    ];
});
~~~

### Custom Content Type

`League\Route\Strategy\JsonStrategy` defaults to using `application/json` for array responses or responses without a `Content-Type` header defined. The default content type can be changed by using the `setContentType` method:

~~~php
// Use the correct content type for JSON-API responses
$strategy->setContentType('application/vnd.api+json');
~~~

Setting the content type will not alter how the response is encoded.

### Exception Decorators

`League\Route\Strategy\JsonStrategy` will decorate all exceptions, `NotFound`, `MethodNotAllowed`, and any 4xx or 5xx exceptions as a JSON Response, setting the correct HTTP status code and content type header in the process.

~~~json
{
    "status_code": 404,
    "message": "Not Found"
}
~~~

#### HTTP 4xx Exceptions

In a RESTful API, covering all outcomes and returning the correct 4xx response can become quite verbose. Therefore, the dispatcher provides a convenient way to ensure you can return the correct response without the need for a conditional being created for every outcome.

Simply throw one of the HTTP exceptions from within your application layer and the strategy will catch the exception and build the appropriate response.

~~~php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

use League\Route\Http\Exception\BadRequestException;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

$router = new League\Route\Router;

$router->post('/acme', function (ServerRequestInterface $request) : ResponseInterface {
    throw new BadRequestException;
});
~~~

##### Available HTTP Exceptions

## Custom Strategies

You can build your own custom strategy to use in your application as long as it is an implementation of `League\Route\Strategy\StrategyInterface`. A strategy is tasked with:

1. Providing a middleware that invokes your controller then decorates and returns your controllers response.
2. Providing a middleware that will decorate a 404 `NotFoundException` and return a response.
3. Providing a middleware that will decorate a 405 `MethodNotAllowedException` and return a response.
4. Providing a middleware that will decorate any other exception and return a response.

~~~php
<?php

namespace League\Route\Strategy;

use Exception;
use League\Route\Http\Exception\{MethodNotAllowedException, NotFoundException};
use League\Route\Route;
use Psr\Http\Message\{ResponseInterface, ServerRequestInterface};
use Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface;

interface StrategyInterface
{
    /**
     * Invoke the route callable based on the strategy.
     *
     * @param \League\Route\Route                      $route
     * @param \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request
     *
     * @return \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface
     */
    public function invokeRouteCallable(Route $route, ServerRequestInterface $request) : ResponseInterface;

    /**
     * Get a middleware that will decorate a NotFoundException
     *
     * @param \League\Route\Http\Exception\NotFoundException $exception
     *
     * @return \Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface
     */
    public function getNotFoundDecorator(NotFoundException $exception) : MiddlewareInterface;

    /**
     * Get a middleware that will decorate a NotAllowedException
     *
     * @param \League\Route\Http\Exception\NotFoundException $exception
     *
     * @return \Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface
     */
    public function getMethodNotAllowedDecorator(MethodNotAllowedException $exception) : MiddlewareInterface;

    /**
     * Get a middleware that acts as an exception handler, it should wrap the rest of the
     * middleware stack and catch eny exceptions.
     *
     * @return \Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface
     */
    public function getExceptionHandler() : MiddlewareInterface;
}

The best way to learn how to create a custom strategy is to look at the strategies that Route provides by default, they can be found [here](https://github.com/thephpleague/route/tree/master/src/Strategy).
